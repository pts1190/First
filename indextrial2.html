        We all can point to accidents where if someone had only done something
        different, if they had followed the procedure, if they had not made a
        mistake, then the accident wouldn’t have happened. Humans appear to be
        the most unreliable part of our systems. So we spend a lot of time in
        the safety profession dealing with “unsafe behavior” in the form of
        incentive programs, training, or calls for more accountability. More
        mature organizations might even push for improving “safety culture” by
        initiatives designed to get people to care more about safety, or try to
        eliminate unsafe acts by designing people out as much as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        This presentation will look closely at the underlying processes that
        lead to what we call “unsafe behavior.” When we do this, we see that
        what we call “unsafe behavior” is just people trying to get work done in
        an imperfect world. What’s more, by calling it “unsafe behavior” we may
        be stopping ourselves from making things better. Is there a better way
        to look at human performance that is more accurate and gets us better
        results?
